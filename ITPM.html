																<li>Update WBS and Gantt charts for the revised Runi timeline, including software fixes and demo creation.</li>
																<li>Compare annual earnings potential between ARMband (at 8% or 11%) and delayed Runi promotion.</li>
																<li>Evaluate implications of a potential Runes withdrawal on influencer strategy and long-term value.</li>
															</ul>
															<p></p>
												
															<p><strong>Key Deliverables:</strong></p>
															<ul>
																<li>PowerPoint slide deck with citations and visual clarity.</li>
																<li>Recorded 20-minute video presentation with clear audio and pacing (100–150 words per minute).</li>
																<li>Written transcript of the video suitable for business use, including figures, references, and analysis.</li>
															</ul>

													<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>
												
													<p><strong>Unit 1: Introductory Seminar</strong></p>
													<p>This seminar introduced the scope of IT Project Management (ITPM) and outlined key concepts, roles, and responsibilities. Emphasis was placed on understanding project life cycles, stakeholder engagement, and aligning project goals with business strategy. The session also laid the foundation for analysing real-world project challenges in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Unit 2: Requirements Management – Using the Gherkin Language</strong></p>
													<p>We explored structured requirements gathering through the use of the Gherkin language, which supports Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). The seminar focused on translating business needs into actionable project requirements using “Given–When–Then” statements. This approach was shown to improve clarity and reduce miscommunication between technical teams and stakeholders.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Unit 4: Project Forecasting and Estimating</strong></p>
													<p>This session covered forecasting techniques and estimation strategies critical to project planning and resource allocation. We examined top-down and bottom-up estimation, analogous and parametric methods, and the use of buffers. Practical exercises included developing a Python-based estimation tool that incorporated risk factors and resource predictions to support evidence-based project scheduling.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Unit 6: The Future of Project Management</strong></p>
													<p>This formative discussion explored evolving challenges and innovations in ITPM. Through case study analysis, we reflected on notable project failures and what they reveal about the necessity for effective project governance. Topics included agile transformation, sustainability, and integrating AI and automation into project delivery frameworks.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Discussion Forum Reflection</strong></p>
													<p>My contribution focused on the NHS IT failure, which highlighted the critical need for proper stakeholder analysis and continuous risk management. This case underlined the importance of adaptable methodologies, transparent communication, and governance frameworks. Peer discussions provided additional perspectives on how poor estimation and unmanaged complexity can derail large-scale projects.</p>
