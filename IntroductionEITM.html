												<h3>Assignment 1: Collaborative Learning Questions</h3>
												<p><strong>Summary Post:</strong><br>Arguing that the integration of a central digital ERP in Miele’s EIT structure was one of the biggest changes for the company is true, but it does not include the whole impact the adoption of EIT had for Miele. There are also other aspects worth mentioning, such as data management and the change management towards a digital EIT infrastructure (Khajed Hosseini et al., 2010).</p>

												<p>Using the COBIT 5 framework, the challenges for Miele become clearer. The COBIT framework can be divided into five key components, of which three aspects are especially relevant to track the impact the adoption of EIT had for Miele (Mangalaraj, G. et al., 2014):</p>
												
												<ul>
												  <li><strong>Covering the enterprise end-to-end:</strong> This shows that good documentation and project setup are necessary.</li>
												  <li><strong>Meeting stakeholder needs:</strong> Miele covered this aspect by implementing a global organizational change management strategy that balanced conflicts of interest and managed acceptance, reducing the use of shadow IT.</li>
												  <li><strong>Enabling a holistic approach:</strong> With 50 subsidiaries worldwide, maintaining a balance between local optimizations and company-wide performance was one of the biggest challenges Miele had to overcome (Khajed Hosseini et al., 2010).</li>
												</ul>
												<p></p>
												
												<p>Further, external and internal factors like technological innovation and societal factors have massively influenced Miele’s development over the last 20 years. For example, Miele developed machines that were convenient and sustainable. This included programmable washer extractors introduced in 2004 and the purchase of the company KptnCook in 2021, which established an app for healthy and sustainable cooking (Miele & Cie. KG, n.d.).</p>
												
												<p>Overall, the adoption of EIT management at Miele is on track to be the most significant change for the company, improving not only elasticity and resilience but also refining the way people work and how Miele sells. The opportunity to develop new skillsets for employees and improve the speed of business processes lays a good foundation for Miele’s future growth. Even the internal and external factors such as innovation rely on IT technology and therefore on EIT.</p>

												<h3>Assigment 2: Individual Programming Exercise</h3>
												<p><p>For this programming exercise, I compared different sorting algorithms in Python to analyze their performance on a large dataset containing over a million integers. I began by implementing a chosen sorting algorithm, replacing the basic algorithm provided in the initial Python program. The task involved sorting the integers of a file and comparing the performance of the selected algorithm with Python’s built-in sort function and an algorithm demonstrated in class, which was implemented in a compiled language like C.</p>

												<p>To achieve a Distinction, I not only compared the performance of my custom sorting algorithm but also created a third application using Python's built-in sort function. I then compared the execution times of all three methods: my selected algorithm, Python's built-in sort, and the one demonstrated in class. The Python built-in sort function, which is highly optimized, outperformed the custom algorithm and the compiled language implementation due to Python's efficient underlying algorithms like Timsort.</p>
												
												<p>Additionally, I incorporated timing functions into the program to accurately measure and compare the performance of the algorithms. The built-in sort function was faster than the other two methods due to its optimization for real-world data. I also implemented a hash function to generate a hash for the sorted text file, which was later modified to include my personal information. The difference in hash values before and after the modification highlighted how even minor changes to a file's contents significantly affect its hash value.</p>
												
												<p>Overall, the exercise demonstrated a deep understanding of sorting algorithms, performance analysis, and file integrity checks through hashing, all of which are crucial for effective IT service management. This comprehensive approach, along with critical evaluations and systematic problem-solving techniques, helped me achieve a Distinction in this exercise.</p>

												<h3>Assignment 3: Individual Presentation</h3>
												<p>	 <p>
													In this presentation, I focused on the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on various industries, my personal work life, and specifically highlighted the influence of ChatGPT. I began by discussing various definitions of AI, agreeing that AI simulates intelligent human behavior and interacts with humans. I expressed mixed feelings about AI—optimism about its potential to handle repetitive tasks but acknowledged concerns like job displacement and security risks.
												</p>
											
												<p>
													I emphasized <strong>reflection</strong> on ChatGPT, acknowledging its strengths in content generation and coding error correction but also pointing out its limitations, such as dependency on the technology and potential privacy issues. I also discussed how AI, particularly ChatGPT, may impact small and traditional companies, suggesting that they might struggle with adopting new technologies, similar to the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
												</p>
											
												<p>
													The reflection part of my presentation reveals my evolving perspective on AI. Initially apprehensive about learning programming, I overcame these challenges, developing a deeper understanding of AI's practical applications. This journey not only enhanced my technical skills but also strengthened my confidence and curiosity in AI, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in an AI-driven world. I also reflected on the need for sustainable AI practices, underscoring my commitment to ethical and environmentally responsible AI adoption.

												<h2>Meeting Notes</h2>
												<p>	<p><strong>BOKs as a Stepping Stone to Unifying the Community</strong>
												<br>
													Bodies of Knowledge (BOKs) serve as foundational frameworks that unify diverse communities within the IT and business fields. They provide structured guidelines, best practices, and standardized knowledge, enabling professionals to align on common goals, terminologies, and methodologies.
												</p>
											
												<p><strong>TOGAF & ADM Cycle</strong>
												<br>
													The TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) provides a comprehensive approach to enterprise architecture. The ADM (Architecture Development Method) cycle is at the core of TOGAF, guiding the process from preliminary phases to architecture vision, implementation, and governance. This iterative cycle ensures continuous improvement and alignment with business goals.
												</p>
											
												<p><strong>EIT Tree & Pyramid</strong>
												<br>
													The Enterprise IT (EIT) Tree and Pyramid models represent the hierarchical and interconnected nature of IT components within an organization. The EIT Tree emphasizes the organic growth and branching of IT elements, while the Pyramid model highlights the structured layers of IT infrastructure, from foundational technologies to business applications.
												</p>
											
												<p><strong>Shadow IT vs. Enterprise IT</strong>
												<br>
													Shadow IT refers to the use of IT systems, software, and services without the approval of the enterprise IT department. This contrasts with Enterprise IT, which is officially sanctioned and managed. While Shadow IT can offer flexibility, it also poses risks such as security vulnerabilities and compliance issues, making it a critical area for governance.
												</p>
											
												<p><strong>Four Programming Paradigms</strong>
												<br>
													Programming paradigms are styles of programming that differ in the way they structure and execute instructions. The four main paradigms are:
												
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Procedural Programming:</strong> Focuses on procedures or routines to operate on data.</li>
													<li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Centers around objects and their interactions.</li>
													<li><strong>Functional Programming:</strong> Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.</li>
													<li><strong>Logic Programming:</strong> Based on formal logic, where you define rules and the system infers conclusions.</li>
												</ul>
												<p></p>
											
												<p><strong>Different Sorting Algorithms for Different Use Cases</strong>
												<br>
													Sorting algorithms are essential for organizing data efficiently. Different algorithms excel in different scenarios:
												
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Bubble Sort:</strong> Simple but inefficient for large datasets.</li>
													<li><strong>Quick Sort:</strong> Efficient for large datasets with an average-case time complexity of O(n log n).</li>
													<li><strong>Merge Sort:</strong> Stable and works well for linked lists or large datasets that don't fit in memory.</li>
													<li><strong>Heap Sort:</strong> Useful in real-time systems where space is at a premium.</li>
												</ul>
												<p></p>
												<p><strong>Different Levels of EA Maturity</strong>
												<br>
													Enterprise Architecture (EA) maturity models assess how well an organization’s EA practices are integrated and optimized. Levels typically range from initial (ad-hoc processes) to optimized (fully integrated and continuously improved processes). Higher maturity levels indicate better alignment with business strategies and more effective governance.
												</p>
										
											
												<p><strong>Software Licensing vs. Open Source</strong>
												<br>
													Software licensing governs the use of proprietary software, often requiring users to pay for the rights to use, modify, or distribute the software. In contrast, open-source software is freely available, with the source code open for modification and distribution. Each model has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, control, and community support.
