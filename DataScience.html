											<h2>Summary</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The Data Science module provides a critical understanding of how organisations manage, analyse, and leverage data to support enterprise decision-making. It explores the concepts underlying Business Intelligence (BI) tools and their impact on digesting diverse data sources and formats to drive effective, enterprise-based systems.
											I developed knowledge of reporting systems and dashboards, learning how to transform raw data into actionable insights that align with business objectives. The module further emphasises the stakeholders’ perspective, focusing on data consolidation, preparation, and the alignment of information flows to strategic goals. It also introduces the management of data policies and regulatory frameworks, underlining the importance of compliance in modern data ecosystems.

												<h3>Assignment 1: Summative Collaborative Discussion </h3>
												<p><p>The first assignment involves a discussion forum spanning over three weeks.</p>

												<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Critically evaluate the paradigm shift towards the convergence of data science, AI, and cybersecurity, drawing on Hero et al. (2023) and Tebout (2021):</p>
											
												<ul>
													<li>Analyse the role of data as the central driver for innovation in AI and cybersecurity.</li>
													<li>Reflect on the implications of emerging trends for data management, security, and enterprise strategy.</li>
													<li>Demonstrate critical awareness of the ethical, social, and professional responsibilities in managing data pipelines and large-scale datasets.</li>
												</ul>
											
											<p></p>
												<strong>Key Deliverables:</strong>
											<p></p>
												<ul>
													<li>Five forum posts; Initial post, three peer responses and one Summary post</li>
												</ul>
											
												<p><p></p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This assignment helped me understand the strategic role of data as both an asset and a vulnerability in digital ecosystems. By critically engaging with Hero et al. (2023) and Tebout (2021), I realised that while convergence creates new possibilities for intelligent, proactive cybersecurity, it also magnifies challenges in scalability, bias, compliance, and explainability.
												Through peer engagement, I recognised the importance of collaboration and multiple perspectives in evaluating emerging technologies—what looks like an opportunity from one perspective (automation, speed) can appear as a risk from another (loss of control, overreliance on AI).
												Overall, the activity strengthened my ability to analyse complex socio-technical systems, to balance innovation with governance, and to reflect on my role as a future data professional who must manage legal, ethical, and professional responsibilities when designing and operating data pipelines.</p>

        <li>Proposed enterprise data architecture, justifying the use of warehouses, lakes, or cloud solutions.</li>
		<li>Rationale report explaining design choices for data tables, integration methods, and analytics tools, with reference to business and stakeholder requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p></p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Through Assignment 2, I strengthened my ability to strategically plan enterprise-level data solutions by evaluating optimal architectures and selecting suitable analytical tools without yet performing the analysis. I gained critical insight into Business Intelligence systems, including reporting platforms, dashboards, and EDA models, and how they support effective decision-making and data visualization. The assignment reinforced the importance of aligning data strategies with business objectives, considering stakeholder requirements, resource efficiency, and the potential to generate actionable insights. Additionally, it enhanced my professional development by building confidence in assessing large-scale datasets, designing end-to-end analytical strategies, and clearly documenting the rationale for each design choice. This preparation laid a solid foundation for implementing the data analysis in Assignment 3, ensuring that all strategic, architectural, and compliance considerations are fully integrated.</p>

											<h3>Reflection</h3>
											<p>This module was generally not too difficult for me, as I had prior experience through my bachelor’s thesis on reporting systems. This prior exposure allowed me to quickly grasp concepts underlying Business Intelligence tools, data integration, and reporting dashboards.
												I was able to build on my existing knowledge to critically evaluate data pipelines, enterprise architectures, and exploratory data analysis frameworks for managing complex datasets like the London road traffic statistics. The module helped reinforce the importance of aligning data preparation and analysis with stakeholder objectives and business goals.
												Through the practical application of BI tools and dashboard development, I strengthened my ability to communicate insights effectively to different audiences, combining visualization, statistical analysis, and narrative. I also gained a deeper appreciation for data compliance, governance, and the ethical responsibilities inherent in managing enterprise-scale datasets.
												Overall, the module enhanced my professional development ethos in data science, particularly in the areas of critical evaluation, system management, and stakeholder-focused analytics, while reinforcing skills I had previously cultivated during my bachelor’s thesis.</ul>
