											<h1>Security and Risk Management<br />
											</h1>
											<h2>Summary</h2>
										</header>
										<p>In the <strong>Security and Risk Management</strong> module, I explored the interconnected nature of security and risk in modern businesses. I learned to apply both <strong>qualitative</strong> and <strong>quantitative risk assessments</strong>, using models like <strong>STRIDE</strong>, <strong>DREAD</strong>, and <strong>Attack Trees</strong> to evaluate and prioritize potential threats. Additionally, I examined <strong>hybrid risk models</strong> for a more comprehensive risk approach.

											I developed skills in creating <strong>threat models</strong> and <strong>quantitative risk models</strong>, as well as understanding global security standards such as <strong>PCI-DSS</strong>. A key focus was on designing effective <strong>Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies</strong>, ensuring business continuity in the event of disruptions like cyberattacks or system failures.
											
											By completing this module, I can confidently assess security risks, develop DR solutions, and apply industry standards to protect business operations, making me well-prepared to manage security and risk in enterprise environments.</p>

											<p><strong>Uncertainty vs Risk:</strong></p>
											<p>Risk is defined as a situation where the outcomes and the probability of the outcome can be estimated, for example by past events or data. In comparison, uncertainty is defined as a situation where the outcome cannot be determined and is therefore unknown.</p>
											<p><strong>Risk of Digitalisation in Business Models:</strong></p>
											<p>To give an example, the digitalisation of a business is used. Digitalisation can lead to new uncertainty in operations, as it involves different business processes as in traditional business models. However, those uncertainties can be traced and calculated and afterwards managed as potential impacts. Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) highlight how digitalisation in traditional businesses requires careful risk assessment to mitigate these challenges effectively. The case study explores how traditional businesses must adapt their risk management strategies to address digitalisation threats.</p>
											<p><strong>Different Risk Definitions:</strong></p>
											<p>The term risk is defined differently in various academical references. According to the ISO 31000 standard risk is defined as the "effect of uncertainty on objectives," emphasising both positive and negative outcomes. PICA (Probabilistic Impact Cyber Assessment) assesses risks in terms of their likelihood and impact on cybersecurity. The Open FAIR framework quantifies risk by evaluating threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts, while OCTAVE focuses on business risks through self-assessment.</p>
											<p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
											<p>In their study, Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) provide a methodology for risk assessment during digitalisation, highlighting the importance of identifying and managing these risks. By applying frameworks like ISO 31000, PICA, Open FAIR, and OCTAVE, organisations can better navigate the risks of digital transformation, ensuring competitiveness while safeguarding operations.</p>
											<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
											In Unit 1, we had our first seminar of the module, which was particularly interesting because it included students not only from my Master's specialisation but also from another master’s degree, thus providing valuable perspectives. We explored different definitions of risk and were introduced to the module's structure and assignments. The first assignment is a group project, which is exciting for me since it was my first experience with group work in my master’s degree. Further, I was able to apply what I had learned during a group <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=245567#p450172" target="_blank">discussion</a>, where I received positive feedback on my contributions and introduced some new perspectives to the conversation. This experience boosted my confidence and reinforced my understanding of the topics. The authors successfully integrated qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide a comprehensive analysis of user participation in risk management. Their findings emphasise the critical role of user involvement in enhancing risk identification, assessment, and mitigation, while also highlighting adaptive strategies for situations where user access is limited. </p>

										<div class="content">
					
										<div class="content">
											<p><p><strong>Qualitative Approach</strong></p>
											<p>The authors used qualitative methods to deeply explore user participation in risk management. Through interviews with stakeholders, they gathered detailed insights into how user involvement impacts risk management processes and outcomes. This approach allowed for the identification of nuanced factors and themes that may not be evident in quantitative data.</p>
										
											<p><strong>Quantitative Approach</strong></p>
											<p>To validate and generalize their qualitative findings, the authors employed quantitative methods. A survey was conducted with a larger sample size, and statistical analysis was used to test the hypotheses derived from the qualitative phase. This provided a broader perspective and quantified the relationship between user participation and the effectiveness of risk management.</p>
										
											<p><strong>Benefits of Each Approach</strong></p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Qualitative Approach:</strong> Offers an in-depth understanding of user interactions with risk management, helps develop hypotheses, and identifies subtle factors.</li>
												<li><strong>Quantitative Approach:</strong> Enables large-scale hypothesis testing, quantifies relationships, and provides statistical evidence to support or refute qualitative findings.</li>
											</ul>
											<p></p>
											<p><strong>Impact of Lack of User Access on Risk Assessment</strong></p>
											<p>The lack of user access can negatively affect risk assessments by limiting the identification of risks and the development of effective mitigation strategies. Without user input, the richness and accuracy of qualitative methods may be diminished, but quantitative methods using existing data can still be applied. Mitigation strategies include engaging indirect user representatives and leveraging secondary data.</p>
										
											<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
											<p>The authors successfully integrated qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide a comprehensive analysis of user participation in risk management. Their findings emphasise the critical role of user involvement in enhancing risk identification, assessment, and mitigation, while also highlighting adaptive strategies for situations where user access is limited.</p>

												<p><strong>The Open Group Framework (TOGAF):</strong> </p>  
												TOGAF is a widely used enterprise architecture framework that guides organisations in designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise information architecture. It emphasises alignment between IT and business goals, providing tools and methods for effective architecture development. TOGAF helps organisations manage complex technological changes while ensuring consistency and quality across processes.
												</p>
												
												<p><strong>FAIR Method (Factor Analysis of Information Risk):</strong> </p> 
												FAIR is a quantitative risk analysis model that helps organisations understand, analyze, and measure information security risks. It focuses on providing a clear, data-driven view of risks by quantifying factors such as threat frequency and impact. FAIR enables organisations to prioritize security investments by translating risks into financial terms, improving decision-making and resource allocation.

												<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
												This week, I started with my ePortfolio. Since it’s my first time using GitHub, I found the process to be quite challenging and time-consuming. We also had our first group meeting where I was assigned the role of note taker, which helped me stay organized and actively contribute to the team. Our group decided to kick off the assignment by answering questions based on the case study. While this collaboration was productive, I struggled significantly with using GitHub. I tried various YouTube tutorials to understand the platform, but it remained difficult for me to properly commit and push changes. Eventually, after discussing my struggles with fellow students, I received valuable advice to use Visual Studio Code with GitHub integration. This simplified the process and helped me finally get a handle on it.
                                                In addition to working on GitHub, I participated in the collaborative <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=245567#p451937" target="_blank">discussion</a>
												for the week, where I provided feedback on my fellow students' posts.<p></p>

											<p><strong>Threats vs. Vulnerabilities</strong><br>
												Threats and vulnerabilities are foundational concepts in cybersecurity. A threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm to a system or organisation, such as a cyberattack or natural disaster. A vulnerability, on the other hand, is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat. Effective risk management involves identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating potential threats to reduce the overall risk (Whitman & Mattord, 2019).</p>
												
													<strong>The Threat Modelling Manifesto</strong>
													<ul>
														<li>Set of guiding principles aimed at improving the practice of threat modelling</li>

													</ul>
													<p></p>
												
													<strong>STRIDE & DREAD</strong>
													<ul>
														<li>Developed by Microsoft and used in threat modelling</li>
														<li>STRIDE categorizes threats into six types</li>
														<li>Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege</li>
														<li>DREAD evaluates threats based on five factors</li>
														<li>Damage potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability (Herman, 2018)</li>
													</ul>
													<p></p>
													<strong>CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)</strong>
													<ul>
														<li>Common Vulnerability Scoring System</li>
														<li>Rating the severity of security vulnerabilities</li>
														<li>Range from 0 to 10 based on factors such as exploitability, impact, and complexity</li>
														<li>Ensuring that the most critical vulnerabilities are addressed first (Mell et al., 2007)</li>
													</ul>
													<p></p>
													<strong>Attack Trees</strong>
													<ul>
														<li>Conceptual tool used to analyze the security of systems</li>
														<li>Represents potential attack scenarios as a tree structure</li>
														<li>Attack trees help in understanding the paths an attacker might take and identifying where defenses should be strengthened (Schneier, 1999)</li>
													</ul>
													<p></p>
													<strong>OCTAVE Methodology</strong>
													<ul>
														<li>Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation</li>
														<li>Emphasizes a self-directed evaluation process</li>
														<li>Focuses on the assets, threats, and vulnerabilities specific to the organisation (Alberts & Dorofee, 2003)</li>
													</ul>
													<p></p>
													<strong>QTMM (Quantitative Threat Modelling Methodology)</strong>
													<ul>
														<li>Combines qualitative and quantitative methods</li>
														<li>Assesses threats by assigning numerical values to various risk factors</li>
														<li>Particularly useful in complex environments (Xiong & Lagerström, 2019)</li>
													</ul>
													<p></p>
													<strong>PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)</strong>
													<ul>
														<li>PASTA is a risk-centric threat modelling methodology</li>
														<li>Aligns business objectives with technical requirements</li>
														<li>Seven stages</li>
														<li>Provides a comprehensive understanding of threats and vulnerabilities</li>
														<li>Enabling organisations to make informed decisions about security investments (UcedaVelez & Morana, 2015)</li>
													</ul>
													<p></p>
													<strong>OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)</strong>
													<ul>
														<li>OWASP is a nonprofit organisation dedicated to improving software security</li>
														<li>Provides free tools, resources, and guidelines</li>
														<li>OWASP Top Ten, which lists the most critical web application security risks</li>
														<li>Cornerstone of modern web security practices (OWASP, 2021)</li>
													</ul>
													<p></p>
												<p><strong>NIST Overview</strong><br>
													The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a U.S. federal agency that develops and promotes standards and guidelines to enhance the security and resilience of the nation’s cybersecurity infrastructure. One of its most widely recognized contributions is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), which provides a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity risks, widely used across various industries to improve their security postures.</p>
													
														<strong>Positive Points of NIST</strong>

															<li>Adaptable to organisations of all sizes and across different sectors</li>
															<li>Helps express cybersecurity risk both internally and externally</li>
															<li>Aligns cybersecurity efforts with business objectives</li>
															<li>Makes it a practical tool for decision-makers</li>
														</ul>
														<p></p>
														<strong>Negative Points of NIST</strong>
														<ul>
															<li>Can be overwhelming for smaller organisations</li>
															<li>Requires a significant investment of time and expertise</li>
															<li>Flexibility can also lead to inconsistent adoption and application</li>
														</ul>
														<p></p>
													<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
													In Week 3, I gained insights into various threat modeling frameworks, including STRIDE, DREAD, CVSS, Attack Trees, PASTA, and OWASP. These frameworks enhanced my understanding of how to assess risks systematically. During our group assignment, I completed my first hands-on risk assessment for a brick-and-mortar store, where I was responsible for selecting the appropriate risk assessment approach. This task allowed me to apply what I had learned in a practical context. Additionally, I wrote my summary post for the collaborative discussion.
                                                    <p></p>Reflecting on the group work, I encountered challenges in working with team members who had different levels of experience and varying work ethics. It was a learning experience to navigate these differences while still moving towards a shared goal. The diversity of know-how in the group was both a strength and a challenge. Some members brought technical expertise, while others excelled in strategic thinking, and balancing these perspectives required strong communication and compromise.
                                                    <p></p>In my <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=245567#p457249" target="_blank">summary post</a>, I discussed key risks associated with Industry 4.0, as outlined by Kovaite and Stankevičienė (2019), such as technical, data security, and financial risks. However, I critically reflected on their lack of emphasis on human and organisational factors, which are crucial for successful digital transformation. This resonates with Bresciani et al. (2018), who emphasise the importance of organisational culture and leadership, especially for SMEs. I also explored the role of workforce retraining to mitigate job displacement risks, aligning with Frey and Osborne's (2017) concerns, and stressed the need for transparency and trust in AI adoption, as highlighted by Cabiddu et al. (2022). <p></p>

													<p><strong>Shostack (2018, Chapters 3-5)</strong> delves into the practical aspects of threat modelling, emphasising the importance of understanding system components, potential threats, and the design of security controls. The chapters highlight the application of STRIDE, the integration of attack trees, and the need for continuous updates to threat models as systems evolve.</p>

   												 <p><strong>Spring et al. (2021)</strong> builds on foundational cybersecurity concepts, exploring more advanced threat intelligence and the role of causality in understanding cyber incidents. The book critiques traditional risk assessment frameworks like CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), pointing out their limitations in predicting real-world impacts and their failure to account for complex, multi-faceted threats. It highlights the need for more dynamic and context-aware assessment methods.</p>

    											<p><strong>Pia (Practical Impact Analysis)</strong> offers a more nuanced approach to assessing risks, focusing on the real-world implications of vulnerabilities rather than just theoretical scores. The critiques of CVSS mentioned by Spring et al. are further supported by Pia, which highlights the system's shortcomings in capturing the true scope and severity of security risks. The book argues for a more holistic approach to vulnerability management that considers causality and the broader impact on systems.</p>

    											<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
												In preparation for this week's seminar, I studied several resources on threat modelling frameworks. Specifically, I explored the Threat Modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Threat Modelling Cookbook, and the ATT&CK framework. These resources provided a foundation for understanding how to identify and mitigate security threats in a variety of systems. I applied the knowledge gained from these frameworks to various <a href="https://github.com/Gesine-2000/UoE_MSc_EITM/tree/main/Security%20%26%20Risk%20Management/Unit%204" target="_blank">practical examples</a>, demonstrating how theoretical concepts translate into real-world scenarios. <p></p>In addition, we held our weekly group meeting. During this session, we reviewed each team member’s progress, discussed the challenges encountered, and delegated tasks for the upcoming week. For me personally, those meetings are critical to maintain alignment and ensure that we are collectively moving towards our project goals in a timely manner. As I was unable to attend the live seminar session, I watched the recorded lecture. This allowed me to review the material thoroughly, rework the exercises, and integrate the content into my e-portfolio. These activities contribute to my ongoing development in cybersecurity, reinforcing both individual research and collaborative skills in practical settings. The academic literature on threat modelling, such as Shostack's (2014) Threat Modelling: Designing for Security, further reinforces the importance of structured methodologies when assessing potential vulnerabilities in systems.</p>

													<p>In summary, integrating GDPR, PCI-DSS, ISO 27000, and NIST into an organisation's security strategy is essential for compliance and data protection.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
													<p>This week’s unit focused on analysing a <a href="https://github.com/Gesine-2000/UoE_MSc_EITM/tree/main/Security%20%26%20Risk%20Management/Unit%205" target="_blank">case study</a> related to the mishandling of
														personal data, with focus on GDPR. I developed a better understanding of the GDPR regulations by conducting an analysis of the legal and ethical implications of non-compliance (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017). During our weekly group call, we assigned new tasks and reviewed the progress of our project.
														 Most tasks are now complete, and we have shifted to merging our contributions into a single document. I took the lead in drafting the first version of this team document, ensuring that all sections were cohesive and aligned with our goals. This stage has emphasised the importance of clear communication and collaboration within the group. <p></p>Additionally, I revisited my e-portfolio to update its content and reviewed the lecture materials. The variety of topics this week, from GDPR compliance to project management, made it challenging to draw connections, but it reinforced the value of integrating diverse information into both individual and group work. Completing the first draft of our team document is a significant step toward finalizing the project, and I will continue refining it based on group feedback and alignment with academic expectations. </p>

													<p>This week, I focused on reviewing and making the final adjustments to our team
														document. Despite some challenges, such as a team member deleting my initial draft, I am proud of how well the project turned out, but I have a gut feeling that my initial draft met the requirements better. One of the most challenging aspects during the team assignment was shortening our paper while maintaining key content, but I managed to condense it without losing important points. As part of my <a href="https://github.com/Gesine-2000/UoE_MSc_EITM/tree/main/Security%20%26%20Risk%20Management/Unit%206" target="_blank">individual task</a>, I deepened my understanding of key regulatory frameworks, including GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. These regulations play a crucial role in ensuring data privacy and security across various sectors and in several countries such as the European Union (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017), PCI DSS focuses on securing credit card information, and HIPAA protects health information in the healthcare sector. Finally, I completed the peer evaluation, providing constructive feedback on my team member's contributions. Overall, this week has strengthened my skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and regulatory compliance, while reinforcing my understanding of critical data protection laws.</p>

															<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
															<p>Week 7 was a productive and reflective period as I worked towards completing key tasks and refining important aspects of my academic journey. Our team assignment was due, and the collaborative effort involved in wrapping up the project underscored the importance of communication and time management. I actively participated in <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=254046#p470855" target="_blank">discussions</a> about CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), where we explored both its utility and limitations. The critique of CVSS was informed by the work of Spring et al. (2021), which raised key issues in their paper, Time to Change the CVSS? They highlighted the challenges in accurately scoring vulnerabilities across diverse systems, leading us to reflect on how improvements might be made to the scoring model in real-world applications. This deepened my understanding of the nuances in vulnerability assessments.

																Another significant milestone was figuring out how to link my work to my e-portfolio, a process that required not only technical understanding but also an organisational strategy. By creating seamless links between my assignments, reflections, and projects, I was able to enhance the navigability and cohesiveness of my e-portfolio, making it a more user-friendly and professional platform.
																Additionally, I dedicated time to rewriting and perfecting the style of various modules within my e-portfolio. While the content was already in place, this revision allowed me to refine the tone and clarity, ensuring that each section accurately reflected both my knowledge and personal voice. 
																
																Lastly I worked on Allen Downey’s Think Bayes 2 exercises, please see <a href="https://github.com/Gesine-2000/UoE_MSc_EITM/tree/main/Security%20%26%20Risk%20Management/Unit%207" target="_blank">the whole code</a> here, below is a snipped

														<p>Week 8 was an important week as we received feedback on the team assignment, offering valuable insights for future projects. The grade we received highlighted that we should have focused on two well-fitting models and provided a more critical analysis, rather than incorporating too many models. This feedback will guide me to prioritize depth over breadth in future assignments.
															<p></p>In parallel, I began working on quantitative risk modelling, which proved to be quite challenging. This area demands a more advanced mathematical approach, making it less intuitive for me. I successfully carried out the work in Python but faced difficulties with the Yasai add-on. While I was able to install it, I couldn’t get it to function properly yet, which caused some delays. This experience was a reminder of the importance of troubleshooting and persistence when working with complex tools.
															<p></p>Additionally, I continued to actively participate in the ongoing <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=253279#p474411" target="_blank">discussion</a> about CVSS and <a href="https://github.com/Gesine-2000/UoE_MSc_EITM/tree/main/Security%20%26%20Risk%20Management/Unit%208" target="_blank">prepared the Unit 8 seminar</a> . I contributed new perspectives, citing recent resources. One such source was Scip AG. (2023), CVSS v4.0 – Better than v3.1?, which examined the improvements in the updated version of CVSS. I also referred to the podcast by Spring et al. (2020), which introduced SSVC (Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization) as an alternative framework to CVSS. These insights enriched the discussion, pushing us to think critically about the future of vulnerability scoring and assessment frameworks.
															Overall, Week 8 was a mix of learning from feedback, grappling with technical challenges, and expanding my contributions to critical discussions, all of which enhanced my learning and problem-solving skills.

													<p>This week was a mix of challenges and accomplishments. I continued working with Yasai, which I had struggled with previously. However, by the end of the week, things started to come together. A significant part of the progress was figuring out that setting Excel to English resolved some of the issues I was facing. 
														We also had a group meeting this week to discuss our struggles with Yasai and other parts of our work. The meeting was productive, and it was reassuring to know that others were experiencing similar challenges. 
														
														<p></p>During the week, I reflected on vulnerability assessment frameworks, particularly the limitations of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), as <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=254046#p476230" target="_blank">discussed in our forum</a>. I noted that CVSS’s reliance on static metrics can oversimplify complex risks, making it difficult to capture evolving threats (Spring et al., 2021). Additionally, I explored the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) as a more tailored and flexible alternative for risk management, which could address some of the shortcomings of CVSS (Spring et al., 2021).
														
														<p></p>Another key task this week was improving the layout and formatting of my e-portfolio. I focused on ensuring that it displayed well on different devices, which I believe is essential for accessibility and professionalism. Finally, I spent time reviewing the requirements for Assignment 2, which gave me a clearer idea of what needs to be done moving forward.
														Overall, despite the initial difficulties with Yasai, this week was productive, and I feel more prepared for the upcoming tasks.

															Alongside this, I began developing a DR strategy for "Pampered Pets," concentrating on minimizing downtime and ensuring effective data recovery.
														I also spent considerable time refining my e-portfolio, working to improve the layout and format across different devices. Balancing the technical content with design has been challenging, but I’m pleased with the progress. However, with the upcoming deadline, I’ve been feeling a bit pressured, especially as I aim to complete everything to a high standard. Despite these challenges, I remain determined to finish all the work on time,ensure that my portfolio reflects my best efforts an I am well <a href="https://github.com/Gesine-2000/UoE_MSc_EITM/tree/main/Security%20%26%20Risk%20Management/Unit%2010" target="_blank">prepared for seminar 10</a>.

										<p>This week we prepared for the "Great Debate" and studied the document <em>"Science of Security Hard Problems: A Lablet Perspective"</em>, which outlines five key "hard problems" in cybersecurity that are crucial for research and advancement.</p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Scalability and Composability:</strong> This focuses on developing methods to build secure systems from secure components without reanalyzing every part when assembling them into larger systems. The challenge is ensuring security at scale, particularly as systems grow in complexity and incorporate components from diverse sources.</li>
												<li><strong>Policy-Governed Secure Collaboration:</strong> This problem involves creating frameworks to enforce security policies when sharing data across different domains and authority levels. The goal is to ensure secure, policy-driven collaboration across various users and systems.</li>
												<li><strong>Security Metrics-Driven Design and Evaluation:</strong> Researchers are tasked with creating reliable security metrics that can predict and verify if a system meets its security goals. These metrics would guide the design, development, and deployment of secure systems.</li>
												<li><strong>Resilient Architectures:</strong> This problem aims to design systems that continue functioning even when parts are compromised. The focus is on ensuring that system architectures can maintain essential operations despite attacks or failures.</li>
												<li><strong>Understanding and Accounting for Human Behaviour:</strong> This problem explores how to model both user and adversary behaviour to design systems that can anticipate and mitigate human-related security risks, including social engineering and insider threats.</li>

I researched emerging trends to ensure I can contribute meaningfully to the discussion.
														In parallel, I enhanced the design and content of my e-portfolio based on my lecturer's informal feedback. These updates helped me better showcase my skills and learning progress.
														Reflecting on the entire module, I feel proud of how much I’ve learned, especially in overcoming challenges with MTC and Yasai. I struggled initially, but with persistence, I now have a solid grasp of these key concepts. Overall, I’m happy with my progress and looking forward to the final debate.

												<h3>Assignment 1</h3>
												<p>In Assignment 1, my team conducted a thorough risk assessment of Pampered Pets, evaluating both its current operations and the potential risks of digital transformation. We used multiple risk assessment methods to cover all aspects of the business.

													ISO 31000 was chosen for its broad and flexible approach to managing risks. For operational risks, we applied FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) to provide a detailed evaluation. STRIDE was used to prioritize technological and cybersecurity risks, addressing potential threats to their IT infrastructure. To ensure data protection, we applied the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) to evaluate information security, aligning with ISO/IEC 27001 standards. Lastly, we used the PESTLE framework to assess external risks such as political, economic, and social factors that could impact the business during its transformation.
													
													Based on these assessments, we recommended proceeding with digitalisation to enable business growth, enhance efficiency, and meet customer demands, while carefully mitigating the identified risks.</p>

												<h3>Assigment 2</h3>
												<p>In Assignment 2, I conducted a quantitative risk assessment of Pampered Pets' digitalisation using Monte Carlo simulation in Python. This approach was selected to model the risks associated with introducing an international supply chain and automating warehouses. Key variables like delivery times, supplier reliability, and quality control were simulated, with data sourced from industry reports and academic literature.

													The simulation revealed a moderate probability of supply chain disruptions, particularly delays in international shipments and potential stock shortages in automated warehouses. There was also a small risk of product quality degradation due to variations in ingredient sourcing from international suppliers. Mitigations included securing secondary suppliers, implementing strict quality checks, and enhancing cybersecurity for automated processes.
													
													 Additionally, I developed a Disaster Recovery (DR) strategy for the online business, ensuring the platform could switch over in less than 1 minute with minimal data loss. A cloud-based platform was suggested to avoid vendor lock-in, maintain 24/7 availability, and comply with GDPR requirements. This approach aims to support business continuity while mitigating risks tied to the new digital operations.</p>

												<h3>Assignment 3</h3>
												<p>Assignment 3 involves the creation of an e-portfolio and a reflective piece that explores my personal development and career goals. This e-portfolio showcases my work throughout my MSc degree, including assignments, projects, and key learnings. While we faced some challenges in the group Assignment 1, in Assignment 3, I took a deeper look at those issues, analysing the errors and problems we encountered in our group assignment. This reflective piece also highlights how the knowledge and skills I have gained have shaped my professional development, especially as I transition from a Project Manager to an aspiring IT Consultant. Additionally, I outline my long-term goals and the steps I plan to take, using the SMART framework to guide my progress.</p>
