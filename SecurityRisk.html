									<h2>Unit 1: An Introduction to Security and Risk Management</h2>
								</header>

											<p><strong>Uncertainty vs Risk:</strong></p>
											<p>Risk is defined as a situation where the outcomes and the probability of the outcome can be estimated, for example by past events or data. In comparison, uncertainty is defined as a situation where the outcome cannot be determined and is therefore unknown.</p>
											<p><strong>Risk of Digitalization in Business Models:</strong></p>
											<p>To give an example, the digitalisation of a business is used. Digitalisation can lead to new uncertainty in operations, as it involves different business processes as in traditional business models. However, those uncertainties can be traced and calculated and afterwards managed as potential impacts. Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) highlight how digitalization in traditional businesses requires careful risk assessment to mitigate these challenges effectively. The case study explores how traditional businesses must adapt their risk management strategies to address digitalisation threats.</p>
											<p><strong>Different Risk Definitions:</strong></p>
											<p>The term risk is defined differently in various academical references. According to the ISO 31000 standard risk is defined as the "effect of uncertainty on objectives," emphasizing both positive and negative outcomes. PICA (Probabilistic Impact Cyber Assessment) assesses risks in terms of their likelihood and impact on cybersecurity. The Open FAIR framework quantifies risk by evaluating threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts, while OCTAVE focuses on business risks through self-assessment.</p>
											<p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
											<p>In their study, Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) provide a methodology for risk assessment during digitalisation, highlighting the importance of identifying and managing these risks. By applying frameworks like ISO 31000, PICA, Open FAIR, and OCTAVE, organisations can better navigate the risks of digital transformation, ensuring competitiveness while safeguarding operations.</p>
											<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
											In Unit 1, we had our first seminar of the module, which was particularly interesting because it included students not only from my Master's specialisation but also from another master’s degree, thus providing valuable perspectives. We explored different definitions of risk and were introduced to the module's structure and assignments. The first assignment is a group project, which is exciting for me since it was my first experience with group work in my master’s degree. I was able to apply what I had learned during a group discussion, where I received positive feedback on my contributions and introduced some new perspectives to the conversation. This experience boosted my confidence and reinforced my understanding of the topics. The authors successfully integrated qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide a comprehensive analysis of user participation in risk management. Their findings emphasize the critical role of user involvement in enhancing risk identification, assessment, and mitigation, while also highlighting adaptive strategies for situations where user access is limited. </p>

									<h2>Unit 2: Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process</h2>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<article>
										<div class="content">
											<p><p><strong>Qualitative Approach</strong></p>
											<p>The authors used qualitative methods to deeply explore user participation in risk management. Through interviews with stakeholders, they gathered detailed insights into how user involvement impacts risk management processes and outcomes. This approach allowed for the identification of nuanced factors and themes that may not be evident in quantitative data.</p>
										
											<p><strong>Quantitative Approach</strong></p>
											<p>To validate and generalize their qualitative findings, the authors employed quantitative methods. A survey was conducted with a larger sample size, and statistical analysis was used to test the hypotheses derived from the qualitative phase. This provided a broader perspective and quantified the relationship between user participation and the effectiveness of risk management.</p>
										
											<p><strong>Benefits of Each Approach</strong></p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Qualitative Approach:</strong> Offers an in-depth understanding of user interactions with risk management, helps develop hypotheses, and identifies subtle factors.</li>
												<li><strong>Quantitative Approach:</strong> Enables large-scale hypothesis testing, quantifies relationships, and provides statistical evidence to support or refute qualitative findings.</li>
											</ul>
										
											<p><strong>Impact of Lack of User Access on Risk Assessment</strong></p>
											<p>The lack of user access can negatively affect risk assessments by limiting the identification of risks and the development of effective mitigation strategies. Without user input, the richness and accuracy of qualitative methods may be diminished, but quantitative methods using existing data can still be applied. Mitigation strategies include engaging indirect user representatives and leveraging secondary data.</p>
										
											<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
											<p>The authors successfully integrated qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide a comprehensive analysis of user participation in risk management. Their findings emphasize the critical role of user involvement in enhancing risk identification, assessment, and mitigation, while also highlighting adaptive strategies for situations where user access is limited.</p>
											<p><strong>ISO 31000:</strong> </p> 
											<ul>
												<li>international standard</li>
												<li>provides guidelines for risk management</li>
												<li>emphasizes a structured, comprehensive approach</li>
												<li>applicable to any business, regardless of size or industry</li>
												<li>covers risk identification, assessment, and mitigation</li>
												<li>aims to improve decision-making and achieve individual goals</li>
											</ul> 
												
												<p><strong>The Open Group Framework (TOGAF):</strong> </p>  
												TOGAF is a widely used enterprise architecture framework that guides organizations in designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise information architecture. It emphasizes alignment between IT and business goals, providing tools and methods for effective architecture development. TOGAF helps organizations manage complex technological changes while ensuring consistency and quality across processes.
												</p>
												
												<p><strong>FAIR Method (Factor Analysis of Information Risk):</strong> </p> 
												FAIR is a quantitative risk analysis model that helps organizations understand, analyze, and measure information security risks. It focuses on providing a clear, data-driven view of risks by quantifying factors such as threat frequency and impact. FAIR enables organizations to prioritize security investments by translating risks into financial terms, improving decision-making and resource allocation.
												</p>
												<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
												This week, I started with my ePortfolio. Since it’s my first time using GitHub, I found the process to be quite challenging and time-consuming. We also had our first group meeting where I was assigned the role of note taker, which helped me stay organized and actively contribute to the team. Our group decided to kick off the assignment by answering questions based on the case study. While this collaboration was productive, I struggled significantly with using GitHub. I tried various YouTube tutorials to understand the platform, but it remained difficult for me to properly commit and push changes. Eventually, after discussing my struggles with fellow students, I received valuable advice to use Visual Studio Code with GitHub integration. This simplified the process and helped me finally get a handle on it.
                                                In addition to working on GitHub, I participated in the collaborative discussion for the week, where I provided feedback on my fellow students' posts. <p></p>

											<p><strong>Threats vs. Vulnerabilities</strong><br>
												Threats and vulnerabilities are foundational concepts in cybersecurity. A threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm to a system or organization, such as a cyberattack or natural disaster. A vulnerability, on the other hand, is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat. Effective risk management involves identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating potential threats to reduce the overall risk (Whitman & Mattord, 2019).</p>
												
													<strong>The Threat Modelling Manifesto</strong>

													<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
													In Week 3, I gained insights into various threat modeling frameworks, including STRIDE, DREAD, CVSS, Attack Trees, PASTA, and OWASP. These frameworks enhanced my understanding of how to assess risks systematically. During our group assignment, I completed my first hands-on risk assessment for a brick-and-mortar store, where I was responsible for selecting the appropriate risk assessment approach. This task allowed me to apply what I had learned in a practical context. Additionally, I wrote my summary post for the collaborative discussion.
                                                    Reflecting on the group work, I encountered challenges in working with team members who had different levels of experience and varying work ethics. It was a learning experience to navigate these differences while still moving towards a shared goal. The diversity of know-how in the group was both a strength and a challenge. Some members brought technical expertise, while others excelled in strategic thinking, and balancing these perspectives required strong communication and compromise.
                                                    In my summary post, I discussed key risks associated with Industry 4.0, as outlined by Kovaite and Stankevičienė (2019), such as technical, data security, and financial risks. However, I critically reflected on their lack of emphasis on human and organizational factors, which are crucial for successful digital transformation. This resonates with Bresciani et al. (2018), who emphasize the importance of organizational culture and leadership, especially for SMEs. I also explored the role of workforce retraining to mitigate job displacement risks, aligning with Frey and Osborne's (2017) concerns, and stressed the need for transparency and trust in AI adoption, as highlighted by Cabiddu et al. (2022). <p></p>

										<div class="content">
											<article>
												<div class="content">
													<p><strong>Shostack (2018, Chapters 3-5)</strong> delves into the practical aspects of threat modelling, emphasizing the importance of understanding system components, potential threats, and the design of security controls. The chapters highlight the application of STRIDE, the integration of attack trees, and the need for continuous updates to threat models as systems evolve.</p>

   												 <p><strong>Spring et al. (2021)</strong> builds on foundational cybersecurity concepts, exploring more advanced threat intelligence and the role of causality in understanding cyber incidents. The book critiques traditional risk assessment frameworks like CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), pointing out their limitations in predicting real-world impacts and their failure to account for complex, multi-faceted threats. It highlights the need for more dynamic and context-aware assessment methods.</p>

    											<p><strong>Pia (Practical Impact Analysis)</strong> offers a more nuanced approach to assessing risks, focusing on the real-world implications of vulnerabilities rather than just theoretical scores. The critiques of CVSS mentioned by Spring et al. are further supported by Pia, which highlights the system's shortcomings in capturing the true scope and severity of security risks. The book argues for a more holistic approach to vulnerability management that considers causality and the broader impact on systems.</p>

    											<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
												In preparation for this week's seminar, I studied several resources on threat modelling frameworks. Specifically, I explored the Threat Modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Threat Modelling Cookbook, and the ATT&CK framework. These resources provided a foundation for understanding how to identify and mitigate security threats in a variety of systems. I applied the knowledge gained from these frameworks to various practical examples, demonstrating how theoretical concepts translate into real-world scenarios. In addition, we held our weekly group meeting. During this session, we reviewed each team member’s progress, discussed the challenges encountered, and delegated tasks for the upcoming week. For me personally, those meetings are critical to maintain alignment and ensure that we are collectively moving towards our project goals in a timely manner. As I was unable to attend the live seminar session, I watched the recorded lecture. This allowed me to review the material thoroughly, rework the exercises, and integrate the content into my e-portfolio. These activities contribute to my ongoing development in cybersecurity, reinforcing both individual research and collaborative skills in practical settings. The academic literature on threat modelling, such as Shostack's (2014) Threat Modelling: Designing for Security, further reinforces the importance of structured methodologies when assessing potential vulnerabilities in systems.</p>

													<p><strong>GDPR, PCI-DSS, ISO 27000, and NIST: Data Protection and Security</strong></p>
    
													<p>In the digital age, protecting sensitive information is crucial. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), ISO 27000, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework are key frameworks that guide organizations in safeguarding data.</p>
													
													<strong>GDPR (Barafort et al., 2018)</strong>

														<li>Protecting Personal Data</li>
														<li>Enforced in May 2018</li>
														<li>Protecting the personal data of EU citizens</li>
														<li>Requires organizations to obtain explicit consent, ensure data minimization, and provide individuals with rights to access and erase their data</li>
													</ul>
												
													<strong>PCI-DSS (Kirvan, 2021)</strong>
													<ul>
														<li>Securing Payment Card Information</li>

													</ul>
													
													<p>In summary, integrating GDPR, PCI-DSS, ISO 27000, and NIST into an organization's security strategy is essential for compliance and data protection.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
													<p>This week’s unit focused on analysing a case study related to the mishandling of
														personal data, with focus on GDPR. I developed a better understanding of the GDPR regulations by conducting an analysis of the legal and ethical implications of non-compliance (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017). During our weekly group call, we assigned new tasks and reviewed the progress of our project.
														 Most tasks are now complete, and we have shifted to merging our contributions into a single document. I took the lead in drafting the first version of this team document, ensuring that all sections were cohesive and aligned with our goals. This stage has emphasized the importance of clear communication and collaboration within the group. Additionally, I revisited my e-portfolio to update its content and reviewed the lecture materials. The variety of topics this week, from GDPR compliance to project management, made it challenging to draw connections, but it reinforced the value of integrating diverse information into both individual and group work. Completing the first draft of our team document is a significant step toward finalizing the project, and I will continue refining it based on group feedback and alignment with academic expectations. </p>

													<p>Businesses today must adapt to various data protection regulations, such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA, to secure sensitive information. Each framework focuses on specific industries and data types. </p>
    											<p><strong>HIPAA: Safeguarding Health Information</strong></p>
    											<p>In the U.S., the <strong>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</strong> mandates protecting personal health information (PHI). Covered entities must secure electronic PHI (ePHI) through encryption, access controls, and breach notification procedures. Violations can result in severe penalties (HIPAA, 2020).</p>

    											<p><strong>Mitigations for Compliance</strong></p>
   												 <ul>
    										    <li><strong>GDPR:</strong> Appoint a responsible DPO, perform regular internal and external audits, and integrate privacy into data handling processes.</li>
     										   <li><strong>PCI-DSS:</strong> Encrypt payment data, implement robust access controls, and conduct regular vulnerability scans.</li>
     										   <li><strong>HIPAA:</strong> Train employees on data protection, implement encryption and establish breach notification protocols.</li>
    											</ul>

													<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
													<p>This week, I focused on reviewing and making the final adjustments to our team
														document. Despite some challenges, such as a team member accidentally deleting my initial draft, I am proud of how well the project turned out, but I have a gut feeling that my initial draft met the requirements better. One of the most challenging aspects during the team assignment was shortening our paper while maintaining key content, but I managed to condense it without losing important points. As part of my individual task, I deepened my understanding of key regulatory frameworks, including GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. These regulations play a crucial role in ensuring data privacy and security across various sectors and in several countries such as the European Union (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017), PCI DSS focuses on securing credit card information, and HIPAA protects health information in the healthcare sector (McEvoy et al., 2017). Finally, I completed the peer evaluation, providing constructive feedback on my team member's contributions. Overall, this week has strengthened my skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and regulatory compliance, while reinforcing my understanding of critical data protection laws.</p>
