									<h2>Unit 1: Introduction into Risk Management</h2>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<article>
										<div class="content">
											<p><strong>Uncertainty vs Risk:</strong></p>
											<p>Uncertainty refers to situations where the outcomes are unknown and cannot be predicted or quantified. In contrast, risk involves situations where the probability of different outcomes can be estimated, often using historical data. For example, digitalization introduces uncertainty in traditional business models as it can lead to unforeseen changes. However, once these uncertainties are identified, they can be managed as risks by quantifying potential impacts and probabilities.</p>
											
											<p><strong>Risk of Digitalization in Business Models:</strong></p>
											<p>Digitalization can revolutionize business models, offering efficiency and new revenue streams, but it also introduces risks such as data breaches, cyber threats, and technological obsolescence. These risks can disrupt operations and harm reputations. Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) highlight how digitalization in traditional businesses requires careful risk assessment to mitigate these challenges effectively. The case study explores how traditional businesses must adapt their risk management strategies to address digitalization's unique threats.</p>
											
											<p><strong>Different Risk Definitions:</strong></p>
											<p>Various frameworks define risk differently. The <em>ISO 31000</em> standard defines risk as the "effect of uncertainty on objectives," emphasizing both positive and negative outcomes. <em>PICA</em> (Probabilistic Impact Cyber Assessment) assesses risks in terms of their likelihood and impact on cybersecurity. The <em>Open FAIR</em> (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) method quantifies risk by evaluating threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts, while <em>OCTAVE</em> (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) focuses on organizational risks through self-assessment.</p>
											
											<p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
											<p>In their study, Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) explore the risks associated with digitalizing traditional business processes. The case study provides a methodology for risk assessment during digitalization, highlighting the importance of identifying and managing these risks. By applying frameworks like <em>ISO 31000</em>, <em>PICA</em>, <em>Open FAIR</em>, and <em>OCTAVE</em>, businesses can better navigate the uncertainties and risks of digital transformation, ensuring they remain competitive while safeguarding against potential threats.</p>
											
											<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
											In Unit 1, we had our first seminar of the module, which was particularly engaging because it included students not only from my Master's specialisation but also from other disciplines. This diverse mix provided valuable perspectives. We explored different definitions of risk and were introduced to the module's structure and assignments.
                                        The first assignment is a group project, which was both exciting and challenging for me since it was my first experience with group work in my Master's degree. I was able to apply what I had learned during a group discussion, where I received positive feedback on my contributions and introduced some new perspectives to the conversation. This experience boosted my confidence and reinforced my understanding of the topics. <p></p>

									<h2>Unit 2: Qualitative and Quantitative Assessment Approaches</h2>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<article>
										<div class="content">
											<p><p><strong>Qualitative Approach</strong></p>
											<p>The authors used qualitative methods to deeply explore user participation in risk management. Through interviews with stakeholders, they gathered detailed insights into how user involvement impacts risk management processes and outcomes. This approach allowed for the identification of nuanced factors and themes that may not be evident in quantitative data.</p>
										
											<p><strong>Quantitative Approach</strong></p>
											<p>To validate and generalize their qualitative findings, the authors employed quantitative methods. A survey was conducted with a larger sample size, and statistical analysis was used to test the hypotheses derived from the qualitative phase. This provided a broader perspective and quantified the relationship between user participation and the effectiveness of risk management.</p>
										
											<p><strong>Benefits of Each Approach</strong></p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Qualitative Approach:</strong> Offers an in-depth understanding of user interactions with risk management, helps develop hypotheses, and identifies subtle factors.</li>
												<li><strong>Quantitative Approach:</strong> Enables large-scale hypothesis testing, quantifies relationships, and provides statistical evidence to support or refute qualitative findings.</li>
											</ul>
										
											<p><strong>Impact of Lack of User Access on Risk Assessment</strong></p>
											<p>The lack of user access can negatively affect risk assessments by limiting the identification of risks and the development of effective mitigation strategies. Without user input, the richness and accuracy of qualitative methods may be diminished, but quantitative methods using existing data can still be applied. Mitigation strategies include engaging indirect user representatives and leveraging secondary data.</p>
										
											<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
											<p>The authors successfully integrated qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide a comprehensive analysis of user participation in risk management. Their findings emphasize the critical role of user involvement in enhancing risk identification, assessment, and mitigation, while also highlighting adaptive strategies for situations where user access is limited.</p>
											<p><strong>ISO 31000:</strong> </p>  
												ISO 31000 is an international standard that provides guidelines for risk management. It emphasizes a structured, comprehensive approach applicable to any organization, regardless of size or industry. The standard covers risk identification, assessment, and mitigation, focusing on integrating risk management into organizational processes to enhance decision-making and achieve objectives.
												</p>
												<p><strong>The Open Group Framework (TOGAF):</strong> </p>  
												TOGAF is a widely used enterprise architecture framework that guides organizations in designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise information architecture. It emphasizes alignment between IT and business goals, providing tools and methods for effective architecture development. TOGAF helps organizations manage complex technological changes while ensuring consistency and quality across processes.
												</p>
												
												<p><strong>FAIR Method (Factor Analysis of Information Risk):</strong> </p> 
												FAIR is a quantitative risk analysis model that helps organizations understand, analyze, and measure information security risks. It focuses on providing a clear, data-driven view of risks by quantifying factors such as threat frequency and impact. FAIR enables organizations to prioritize security investments by translating risks into financial terms, improving decision-making and resource allocation.
												</p>
												<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
												This week, I began setting up my ePortfolio, which will be reviewed and graded by the end of the module. Since it’s my first time using GitHub, I found the process to be quite challenging and time-consuming. As part of the group project for our first assignment, I was assigned the role of note taker, which helped me stay organized and actively contribute to the team.
                                                Our group decided to kick off the assignment by answering questions based on the case study. While this collaboration was productive, I struggled significantly with using GitHub. I tried various YouTube tutorials to understand the platform, but it remained difficult for me to properly commit and push changes. Eventually, after discussing my struggles with fellow students, I received valuable advice to use Visual Studio Code with GitHub integration. This simplified the process and helped me finally get a handle on it.
                                                In addition to working on GitHub, I participated in the collaborative discussion for the week, where I provided feedback on my fellow students' posts. <p></p>

									<h2>Unit 3: Threat Modelling</h2>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<article>
										<div class="content">
											<p><strong>Threats vs. Vulnerabilities</strong><br>
												Threats and vulnerabilities are foundational concepts in cybersecurity. A <i>threat</i> is any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm to a system or organization, such as a cyberattack or natural disaster. A <i>vulnerability</i>, on the other hand, is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat, such as an unpatched software flaw or weak password policy. Effective risk management involves identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating potential threats to reduce the overall risk (Whitman & Mattord, 2019).</p>
											
												<p><strong>Threat Modeling Manifesto</strong><br>
												The Threat Modeling Manifesto is a set of guiding principles and values aimed at improving the practice of threat modeling. Developed by a group of security experts, the manifesto emphasizes the importance of understanding the system, identifying what can go wrong, and determining appropriate mitigations. The manifesto promotes a proactive approach to security, advocating for continuous and iterative threat modeling throughout the software development lifecycle (Shostack, 2020).</p>
											
												<p><strong>STRIDE & DREAD</strong><br>
												STRIDE and DREAD are methodologies developed by Microsoft and used in threat modeling. <i>STRIDE</i> categorizes threats into six types: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. It helps security professionals systematically identify potential threats to a system. <i>DREAD</i>, on the other hand, is a risk assessment model that evaluates threats based on five factors: Damage potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability. Both methodologies are used to assess the severity of threats and prioritize them for mitigation (Herman, 2018).</p>
											
												<p><strong>CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)</strong><br>
												The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities. CVSS scores range from 0 to 10 and are based on factors such as exploitability, impact, and complexity. This scoring system is widely used by organizations to prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts, ensuring that the most critical vulnerabilities are addressed first (Mell et al., 2007).</p>
											
												<p><strong>Attack Trees</strong><br>
												Attack trees are a conceptual tool used to analyze the security of systems. They represent potential attack scenarios as a tree structure, where the root is the main objective (e.g., gaining unauthorized access), and the branches are various methods of achieving that goal. Attack trees help in understanding the paths an attacker might take and identifying where defenses should be strengthened (Schneier, 1999).</p>
											
												<p><strong>OCTAVE Methodology</strong><br>
												OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) is a risk assessment methodology that emphasizes a self-directed evaluation process, allowing organizations to identify and manage risks in their information systems. OCTAVE focuses on understanding the assets, threats, and vulnerabilities specific to the organization and developing a customized security strategy (Alberts & Dorofee, 2003).</p>
											
												<p><strong>QTMM (Quantitative Threat Modeling Methodology)</strong><br>
												QTMM is a framework that combines qualitative and quantitative methods for threat modeling. It helps organizations assess threats by assigning numerical values to various risk factors, enabling a more objective analysis. QTMM is particularly useful in complex environments where traditional qualitative methods may not provide sufficient clarity (Xiong & Lagerström, 2019).</p>
											
												<p><strong>PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)</strong><br>
												PASTA is a risk-centric threat modeling methodology that aligns business objectives with technical requirements. It consists of seven stages, including defining business objectives, technical scope, and threat analysis, ultimately leading to the simulation of attacks to understand their potential impact. PASTA is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of threats and vulnerabilities, enabling organizations to make informed decisions about security investments (UcedaVelez & Morana, 2015).</p>
											
												<p><strong>OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)</strong><br>
												OWASP is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving software security. It provides free tools, resources, and guidelines, including the OWASP Top Ten, which lists the most critical web application security risks. OWASP's resources are widely used by developers and security professionals to build and maintain secure applications, making it a cornerstone of modern web security practices (OWASP, 2021).</p>
											
												<p><strong>NIST Overview</strong><br>
													The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a U.S. federal agency that develops and promotes standards and guidelines to enhance the security and resilience of the nation’s cybersecurity infrastructure. One of its most widely recognized contributions is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), which provides a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity risks, widely used across various industries to improve their security postures.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Positive Points of NIST</strong><br>
													The NIST framework is highly valued for its comprehensive and flexible nature. It is designed to be adaptable to organizations of all sizes and across different sectors, offering a common language for understanding, managing, and expressing cybersecurity risk both internally and externally. The framework’s iterative approach encourages continuous improvement, which helps organizations stay current with evolving threats. Moreover, NIST’s strong emphasis on risk management aligns cybersecurity efforts with business objectives, making it a practical tool for decision-makers.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Negative Points of NIST</strong><br>
													Despite its strengths, the NIST framework has some limitations. One critique is that it can be overwhelming for smaller organizations or those with limited resources, as it requires a significant investment of time and expertise to implement effectively. The framework’s flexibility, while generally positive, can also lead to inconsistent adoption and application, potentially reducing its effectiveness. Additionally, the voluntary nature of NIST's guidelines means that compliance is not mandatory, which may lead to gaps in cybersecurity across industries if not adopted uniformly.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
													In Week 3, I gained insights into various threat modeling frameworks, including STRIDE, DREAD, CVSS, Attack Trees, PASTA, and OWASP. These frameworks enhanced my understanding of how to assess risks systematically. During our group assignment, I completed my first hands-on risk assessment for a brick-and-mortar store, where I was responsible for selecting the appropriate risk assessment approach. This task allowed me to apply what I had learned in a practical context. Additionally, I wrote my summary post for the collaborative discussion.
                                                    Reflecting on the group work, I encountered challenges in working with team members who had different levels of experience and varying work ethics. It was a learning experience to navigate these differences while still moving towards a shared goal. The diversity of know-how in the group was both a strength and a challenge. Some members brought technical expertise, while others excelled in strategic thinking, and balancing these perspectives required strong communication and compromise.
                                                    In my summary post, I discussed key risks associated with Industry 4.0, as outlined by Kovaite and Stankevičienė (2019), such as technical, data security, and financial risks. However, I critically reflected on their lack of emphasis on human and organizational factors, which are crucial for successful digital transformation. This resonates with Bresciani et al. (2018), who emphasize the importance of organizational culture and leadership, especially for SMEs. I also explored the role of workforce retraining to mitigate job displacement risks, aligning with Frey and Osborne's (2017) concerns, and stressed the need for transparency and trust in AI adoption, as highlighted by Cabiddu et al. (2022). <p></p>

											<h2>Unit 4: Threat Modelling Further Reading & Exercises</h2>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<article>
												<div class="content">
													<p><strong>Shostack (2018, Chapters 3-5)</strong> delves into the practical aspects of threat modeling, emphasizing the importance of understanding system components, potential threats, and the design of security controls. The chapters highlight the application of STRIDE, the integration of attack trees, and the need for continuous updates to threat models as systems evolve. Shostack stresses the importance of including diverse perspectives in the threat modeling process to identify overlooked vulnerabilities.</p>

   												 <p><strong>Spring et al. (2021)</strong> builds on foundational cybersecurity concepts, exploring more advanced threat intelligence and the role of causality in understanding cyber incidents. The book critiques traditional risk assessment frameworks like CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), pointing out their limitations in predicting real-world impacts and their failure to account for complex, multi-faceted threats. It emphasizes the need for more dynamic and context-aware assessment methods.</p>

    											<p><strong>Pia (Practical Impact Analysis)</strong> offers a more nuanced approach to assessing risks, focusing on the real-world implications of vulnerabilities rather than just theoretical scores. The critiques of CVSS mentioned by Spring et al. are further supported by Pia, which highlights the system's shortcomings in capturing the true scope and severity of security risks. The book argues for a more holistic approach to vulnerability management that considers causality and the broader impact on systems.</p>

    											<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
												In preparation for this week's seminar, I engaged with several key resources on threat modelling frameworks. Specifically, I explored the Threat Modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Threat Modelling Cookbook, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework. These materials provided a comprehensive foundation for understanding different approaches to identifying and mitigating security threats in a variety of systems. I applied the knowledge gained from these frameworks to various practical examples, demonstrating how theoretical concepts translate into real-world scenarios. In addition to individual study, we held our weekly group meeting. During this session, we reviewed each team member’s progress, discussed the challenges encountered, and delegated tasks for the upcoming week. These meetings are critical to maintaining alignment and ensuring that we are collectively moving towards our project goals in a timely manner. As I was unable to attend the live seminar session, I watched the recorded lecture. This allowed me to review the material thoroughly, rework the exercises, and integrate the content into my e-portfolio. The recorded session provided additional context to the reading materials, enhancing my understanding of threat modelling strategies. These activities contribute to my ongoing development in cybersecurity, reinforcing both individual research and collaborative skills in practical settings. The academic literature on threat modelling, such as Shostack's (2014) <em>Threat Modelling: Designing for Security</em>, further reinforces the importance of structured methodologies when assessing potential vulnerabilities in systems.</p>

												<div class="content">
													<p><strong>GDPR, PCI-DSS, ISO 27000, and NIST: Data Protection and Security</strong></p>
    
													<p>In the digital age, protecting sensitive information is crucial. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), ISO 27000, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework are key frameworks that guide organizations in safeguarding data.</p>
													
													<p><strong>GDPR: Protecting Personal Data</strong></p>
													<p>The GDPR, enforced in May 2018, is a regulation aimed at protecting the personal data of EU citizens. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent, ensure data minimization, and provide individuals with rights to access and erase their data. Non-compliance can lead to heavy fines. GDPR encourages a holistic approach to data governance, integrating data protection into core business processes (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2017.10.002">Barafort et al., 2018</a>).</p>
													
													<p><strong>PCI-DSS: Securing Payment Card Information</strong></p>
													<p>PCI-DSS is a standard focused on safeguarding payment card data. It applies to any organization handling credit card transactions and mandates measures like encryption and access control. Compliance reduces the risk of data breaches and helps build customer trust (<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/What-is-PCI-DSS-A-closer-look-at-the-Data-Security-Standard">Kirvan, 2021</a>).</p>
													
													<p><strong>ISO 27000: A Comprehensive Security Framework</strong></p>
													<p>ISO 27000, particularly ISO/IEC 27001, provides a globally recognized framework for managing information security risks. It offers a systematic approach to securing sensitive information and aligns with GDPR and PCI-DSS to ensure comprehensive data protection (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2017.10.002">Barafort et al., 2018</a>).</p>
													
													<p><strong>NIST: Enhancing Cybersecurity Practices</strong></p>
													<p>The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is a voluntary framework that provides a policy framework of computer security guidance for how private sector organizations can assess and improve their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber attacks. The NIST framework is widely adopted in the U.S. and is designed to complement other standards like ISO 27000 and regulations like GDPR. It emphasizes risk management and provides a common language for organizations to address cybersecurity threats.</p>
												
													<p>In summary, integrating GDPR, PCI-DSS, ISO 27000, and NIST into an organization's security strategy is essential for compliance and data protection.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
													<p>This week’s activity focused on analyzing a case study related to the mishandling of personal data, with an emphasis on GDPR. I examined the legal and ethical implications of non-compliance, deepening my understanding of GDPR and the challenges organizations face in adhering to data protection laws (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017).

                                                    During our weekly group call, we assigned new tasks and reviewed the progress of our project. Most tasks are now complete, and we have shifted to merging our contributions into a single document. I took the lead in drafting the first version of this team document, ensuring that all sections were cohesive and aligned with our goals. This stage has emphasized the importance of clear communication and collaboration within the group. Additionally, I revisited my e-portfolio to update its content and reviewed the lecture materials. The variety of topics this week, from GDPR compliance to project management, made it challenging to draw connections, but it reinforced the value of integrating diverse information into both individual and group work. Completing the first draft of our team document is a significant step toward finalizing the project, and I will continue refining it based on group feedback and alignment with academic expectations. Key references, such as Kuner et al. (2020), have provided valuable context for understanding GDPR's broader implications.</p>

													<p>Businesses today must adhere to various data protection regulations, such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA, to secure sensitive information. Each framework focuses on specific industries and data types.</p>

      											<p><strong>GDPR: Protecting Personal Data</strong></p>
   												 <p><strong>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> governs the protection of personal data in the EU. It requires businesses to gain explicit consent for processing data and maintain transparency with individuals. Rights include data access, rectification, and the right to be forgotten. Compliance requires regular <strong>Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)</strong> and appointing a <strong>Data Protection Officer (DPO)</strong> when necessary. Failure to comply can result in fines up to 4% of global revenue (ICO, 2020).</p>

   												<p><strong>PCI-DSS: Securing Payment Data</strong></p>
    											<p>The <strong>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)</strong> ensures the security of credit card data. Key requirements include encryption, access control, and regular vulnerability testing. Non-compliance may lead to fines and revocation of payment processing rights (PCI Security Standards Council, 2020).</p>

    											<p><strong>HIPAA: Safeguarding Health Information</strong></p>
    											<p>In the U.S., the <strong>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</strong> mandates protecting personal health information (PHI). Covered entities must secure electronic PHI (ePHI) through encryption, access controls, and breach notification procedures. Violations can result in severe penalties (HIPAA, 2020).</p>

    											<p><strong>Mitigations for Compliance</strong></p>
   												 <ul>
    										    <li><strong>GDPR:</strong> Appoint a DPO, perform DPIAs regularly, and integrate privacy into data handling processes.</li>
     										   <li><strong>PCI-DSS:</strong> Encrypt payment data, implement robust access controls, and conduct regular vulnerability scans.</li>
     										   <li><strong>HIPAA:</strong> Train employees on data protection, implement encryption for ePHI, and establish breach notification protocols.</li>
    											</ul>

													<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
													<p>This week, I focused on reviewing and making the final adjustments to our team document. Despite some challenges, such as a team member accidentally deleting my initial draft, I’m proud of how well the project turned out. Through effective communication, we resolved the issue, and the final version reflects our collaborative efforts. One of the most challenging aspects was shortening the assignment while maintaining key content, but I managed to condense it without losing important points. As part of my individual task, I deepened my understanding of key regulatory frameworks, including GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. These regulations play a crucial role in ensuring data privacy and security across various sectors. GDPR governs personal data protection in the EU (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017), PCI DSS focuses on securing credit card information, and HIPAA protects health information in the healthcare sector (McEvoy et al., 2017). Understanding these frameworks helped inform both our team assignment and my personal work, ensuring that we considered compliance and security risks in our project. In addition to the group work, I began reflecting on my e-portfolio, documenting my progress. I also created a new GitHub repository for my work, initially struggling with setting up the links but eventually resolving the issues. Finally, I completed the peer evaluation, providing constructive feedback on each team member's contributions. Overall, this week has strengthened my skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and regulatory compliance, while reinforcing my understanding of critical data protection laws.</p>
