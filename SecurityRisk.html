											<p><strong>Uncertainty vs Risk:</strong></p>
											<p>Uncertainty refers to situations where the outcomes are unknown and cannot be predicted or quantified. In contrast, risk involves situations where the probability of different outcomes can be estimated, often using historical data. For example, digitalization introduces uncertainty in traditional business models as it can lead to unforeseen changes. However, once these uncertainties are identified, they can be managed as risks by quantifying potential impacts and probabilities.</p>
											
											<p><strong>Risk of Digitalization in Business Models:</strong></p>
											<p>Digitalization can revolutionize business models, offering efficiency and new revenue streams, but it also introduces risks such as data breaches, cyber threats, and technological obsolescence. These risks can disrupt operations and harm reputations. Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) highlight how digitalization in traditional businesses requires careful risk assessment to mitigate these challenges effectively. The case study explores how traditional businesses must adapt their risk management strategies to address digitalization's unique threats.</p>
											
											<p><strong>Different Risk Definitions:</strong></p>
											<p>Various frameworks define risk differently. The <em>ISO 31000</em> standard defines risk as the "effect of uncertainty on objectives," emphasizing both positive and negative outcomes. <em>PICA</em> (Probabilistic Impact Cyber Assessment) assesses risks in terms of their likelihood and impact on cybersecurity. The <em>Open FAIR</em> (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) method quantifies risk by evaluating threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts, while <em>OCTAVE</em> (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) focuses on organizational risks through self-assessment.</p>
											
											<p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
											<p>In their study, Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) explore the risks associated with digitalizing traditional business processes. The case study provides a methodology for risk assessment during digitalization, highlighting the importance of identifying and managing these risks. By applying frameworks like <em>ISO 31000</em>, <em>PICA</em>, <em>Open FAIR</em>, and <em>OCTAVE</em>, businesses can better navigate the uncertainties and risks of digital transformation, ensuring they remain competitive while safeguarding against potential threats.</p>

									<h2>Unit 2: Qualitative and Quantitative Assessment Approaches</h2>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<article>
										<div class="content">
											<p><p><strong>Qualitative Approach</strong></p>
											<p>The authors used qualitative methods to deeply explore user participation in risk management. Through interviews with stakeholders, they gathered detailed insights into how user involvement impacts risk management processes and outcomes. This approach allowed for the identification of nuanced factors and themes that may not be evident in quantitative data.</p>
										
											<p><strong>Quantitative Approach</strong></p>
											<p>To validate and generalize their qualitative findings, the authors employed quantitative methods. A survey was conducted with a larger sample size, and statistical analysis was used to test the hypotheses derived from the qualitative phase. This provided a broader perspective and quantified the relationship between user participation and the effectiveness of risk management.</p>
										
											<p><strong>Benefits of Each Approach</strong></p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Qualitative Approach:</strong> Offers an in-depth understanding of user interactions with risk management, helps develop hypotheses, and identifies subtle factors.</li>
												<li><strong>Quantitative Approach:</strong> Enables large-scale hypothesis testing, quantifies relationships, and provides statistical evidence to support or refute qualitative findings.</li>
											</ul>
										
											<p><strong>Impact of Lack of User Access on Risk Assessment</strong></p>
											<p>The lack of user access can negatively affect risk assessments by limiting the identification of risks and the development of effective mitigation strategies. Without user input, the richness and accuracy of qualitative methods may be diminished, but quantitative methods using existing data can still be applied. Mitigation strategies include engaging indirect user representatives and leveraging secondary data.</p>
										
											<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
											<p>The authors successfully integrated qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide a comprehensive analysis of user participation in risk management. Their findings emphasize the critical role of user involvement in enhancing risk identification, assessment, and mitigation, while also highlighting adaptive strategies for situations where user access is limited.</p>
											<p><strong>ISO 31000:</strong> </p>  
												ISO 31000 is an international standard that provides guidelines for risk management. It emphasizes a structured, comprehensive approach applicable to any organization, regardless of size or industry. The standard covers risk identification, assessment, and mitigation, focusing on integrating risk management into organizational processes to enhance decision-making and achieve objectives.
												</p>
												<p><strong>The Open Group Framework (TOGAF):</strong> </p>  
												TOGAF is a widely used enterprise architecture framework that guides organizations in designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise information architecture. It emphasizes alignment between IT and business goals, providing tools and methods for effective architecture development. TOGAF helps organizations manage complex technological changes while ensuring consistency and quality across processes.
												</p>
												
												<p><strong>FAIR Method (Factor Analysis of Information Risk):</strong> </p> 
												FAIR is a quantitative risk analysis model that helps organizations understand, analyze, and measure information security risks. It focuses on providing a clear, data-driven view of risks by quantifying factors such as threat frequency and impact. FAIR enables organizations to prioritize security investments by translating risks into financial terms, improving decision-making and resource allocation.

									<h2>Unit 3: Threat Modelling</h2>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<article>
										<div class="content">
											<p><strong>Threats vs. Vulnerabilities</strong><br>
												Threats and vulnerabilities are foundational concepts in cybersecurity. A <i>threat</i> is any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm to a system or organization, such as a cyberattack or natural disaster. A <i>vulnerability</i>, on the other hand, is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat, such as an unpatched software flaw or weak password policy. Effective risk management involves identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating potential threats to reduce the overall risk (Whitman & Mattord, 2019).</p>
											
												<p><strong>Threat Modeling Manifesto</strong><br>
												The Threat Modeling Manifesto is a set of guiding principles and values aimed at improving the practice of threat modeling. Developed by a group of security experts, the manifesto emphasizes the importance of understanding the system, identifying what can go wrong, and determining appropriate mitigations. The manifesto promotes a proactive approach to security, advocating for continuous and iterative threat modeling throughout the software development lifecycle (Shostack, 2020).</p>
											
												<p><strong>STRIDE & DREAD</strong><br>
												STRIDE and DREAD are methodologies developed by Microsoft and used in threat modeling. <i>STRIDE</i> categorizes threats into six types: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. It helps security professionals systematically identify potential threats to a system. <i>DREAD</i>, on the other hand, is a risk assessment model that evaluates threats based on five factors: Damage potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability. Both methodologies are used to assess the severity of threats and prioritize them for mitigation (Herman, 2018).</p>
											
												<p><strong>CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)</strong><br>
												The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities. CVSS scores range from 0 to 10 and are based on factors such as exploitability, impact, and complexity. This scoring system is widely used by organizations to prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts, ensuring that the most critical vulnerabilities are addressed first (Mell et al., 2007).</p>
											
												<p><strong>Attack Trees</strong><br>
												Attack trees are a conceptual tool used to analyze the security of systems. They represent potential attack scenarios as a tree structure, where the root is the main objective (e.g., gaining unauthorized access), and the branches are various methods of achieving that goal. Attack trees help in understanding the paths an attacker might take and identifying where defenses should be strengthened (Schneier, 1999).</p>
											
												<p><strong>OCTAVE Methodology</strong><br>
												OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) is a risk assessment methodology that emphasizes a self-directed evaluation process, allowing organizations to identify and manage risks in their information systems. OCTAVE focuses on understanding the assets, threats, and vulnerabilities specific to the organization and developing a customized security strategy (Alberts & Dorofee, 2003).</p>
											
												<p><strong>QTMM (Quantitative Threat Modeling Methodology)</strong><br>
												QTMM is a framework that combines qualitative and quantitative methods for threat modeling. It helps organizations assess threats by assigning numerical values to various risk factors, enabling a more objective analysis. QTMM is particularly useful in complex environments where traditional qualitative methods may not provide sufficient clarity (Xiong & Lagerström, 2019).</p>
											
												<p><strong>PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)</strong><br>
												PASTA is a risk-centric threat modeling methodology that aligns business objectives with technical requirements. It consists of seven stages, including defining business objectives, technical scope, and threat analysis, ultimately leading to the simulation of attacks to understand their potential impact. PASTA is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of threats and vulnerabilities, enabling organizations to make informed decisions about security investments (UcedaVelez & Morana, 2015).</p>
											
												<p><strong>OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)</strong><br>
												OWASP is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving software security. It provides free tools, resources, and guidelines, including the OWASP Top Ten, which lists the most critical web application security risks. OWASP's resources are widely used by developers and security professionals to build and maintain secure applications, making it a cornerstone of modern web security practices (OWASP, 2021).</p>
											
												<p><strong>NIST Overview</strong><br>
													The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a U.S. federal agency that develops and promotes standards and guidelines to enhance the security and resilience of the nation’s cybersecurity infrastructure. One of its most widely recognized contributions is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), which provides a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity risks, widely used across various industries to improve their security postures.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Positive Points of NIST</strong><br>
													The NIST framework is highly valued for its comprehensive and flexible nature. It is designed to be adaptable to organizations of all sizes and across different sectors, offering a common language for understanding, managing, and expressing cybersecurity risk both internally and externally. The framework’s iterative approach encourages continuous improvement, which helps organizations stay current with evolving threats. Moreover, NIST’s strong emphasis on risk management aligns cybersecurity efforts with business objectives, making it a practical tool for decision-makers.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Negative Points of NIST</strong><br>
													Despite its strengths, the NIST framework has some limitations. One critique is that it can be overwhelming for smaller organizations or those with limited resources, as it requires a significant investment of time and expertise to implement effectively. The framework’s flexibility, while generally positive, can also lead to inconsistent adoption and application, potentially reducing its effectiveness. Additionally, the voluntary nature of NIST's guidelines means that compliance is not mandatory, which may lead to gaps in cybersecurity across industries if not adopted uniformly.</p>

													<p><strong>Shostack (2018, Chapters 3-5)</strong> delves into the practical aspects of threat modeling, emphasizing the importance of understanding system components, potential threats, and the design of security controls. The chapters highlight the application of STRIDE, the integration of attack trees, and the need for continuous updates to threat models as systems evolve. Shostack stresses the importance of including diverse perspectives in the threat modeling process to identify overlooked vulnerabilities.</p>

   												 <p><strong>Spring et al. (2021)</strong> builds on foundational cybersecurity concepts, exploring more advanced threat intelligence and the role of causality in understanding cyber incidents. The book critiques traditional risk assessment frameworks like CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), pointing out their limitations in predicting real-world impacts and their failure to account for complex, multi-faceted threats. It emphasizes the need for more dynamic and context-aware assessment methods.</p>

    											<p><strong>Pia (Practical Impact Analysis)</strong> offers a more nuanced approach to assessing risks, focusing on the real-world implications of vulnerabilities rather than just theoretical scores. The critiques of CVSS mentioned by Spring et al. are further supported by Pia, which highlights the system's shortcomings in capturing the true scope and severity of security risks. The book argues for a more holistic approach to vulnerability management that considers causality and the broader impact on systems.</p>
