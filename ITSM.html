											<h1>IT Service  Management<br />
											</h1>
											<h2>Summary</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The IT Service Management (ITSM) module provides a comprehensive understanding of how organisations manage IT services to meet business objectives and customer needs. It covers key principles and practices, including Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Incident Management, and the roles of the Service Desk and Service Manager.

											The module emphasises operational efficiency, compliance, and continuous improvement, exploring how functional and non-functional requirements integrate with ITSM processes. Students critically analyse IT service challenges, evaluate tools and methodologies, and address ethical, social, and professional considerations. It also highlights future opportunities in ITSM, such as automation and innovation, preparing students for real-world ITSM roles.</ul>

												<h3>Assignment 1: CMDB Design and Demonstration </h3>
												<p><p>The first assignment involves designing a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) for IT security management. This task is essential for understanding how CMDBs support organisational IT functions.</p>

												<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a CMDB design tailored to meet IT security management requirements. The design should address the following:</p>
											
												<ul>
													<li>Asset management: Ensure tracking and documentation of IT assets.</li>
													<li>Vulnerability tracking: Integrate with tools for identifying and managing vulnerabilities.</li>
													<li>Compliance monitoring: Support adherence to regulatory and organisational standards.</li>
													<li>Incident response: Manage and document actions to mitigate incidents.</li>
												</ul>
											
											<p></p>
												<strong>Key Deliverables:</strong>
											<p></p>
												<ul>
													<li>A comprehensive design document detailing the architecture and data schema of the CMDB.</li>
													<li>A prototype demonstrating the functionality and usability of the design.</li>
												</ul>
											
												<p><p></p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This assignment highlights the importance of a structured approach to designing IT infrastructure tools. Through this task, I gained insights into analysing organisational needs and translating them into technical solutions. The focus on security assets and compliance ensures that the CMDB aligns with real-world requirements, fostering a deeper understanding of ITSM principles.</p>

												<h3>Assigment 2: CMDB Implementation and Demonstration</h3>
												<p>Building upon the design from Assignment 1, this task focuses on implementing and demonstrating a functional CMDB prototype.</p>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Implement the CMDB, populate it with data, and demonstrate its capabilities in managing IT services.</p>

    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Implement the data schema and relationships in a suitable tool, such as Microsoft Access.</li>
        <li>Populate the database with sample data representing configuration items (CIs).</li>
        <li>Demonstrate key functionalities, such as CRUD operations, compliance reporting, and impact analysis.</li>
    </ul>


    <p><p>
	</p><strong>Key Deliverables:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Source code and supporting documentation.</li>
        <li>A 5â€“7 minute demonstration video showcasing the prototype.</li>
    </ul>

    <p></p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This assignment offers a hands-on experience in implementing ITSM solutions. By building and demonstrating a working CMDB, I not only applied theoretical concepts but also refine practical skills such as database management and impact analysis. The emphasis on real-world scenarios, like compliance reporting and risk assessments, ensures that the learning outcomes I achieved are both relevant and applicable.</p>

												<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>
												

													<p><strong>Unit 1: Introduction to ITSM</strong></p>
													<p>The seminar introduced fundamental ITSM principles and explored roles such as the Service Desk Manager and Service Manager. Discussions focused on streamlining service delivery and enhancing operational efficiency. Key takeaways included the importance of SLAs, incident management, and aligning ITSM practices with business objectives.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Unit 3: ITSM Frameworks and Standards</strong></p>
													<p>This session provided a comparative analysis of ITIL and COBIT frameworks. We discussed selecting appropriate frameworks based on organisational goals and industry regulations. Insights were gained on leveraging these frameworks to address compliance challenges, particularly with standards like ISO/IEC 20000.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Unit 5: Future Trends in ITSM</strong></p>
													<p>Emerging technologies such as AI-driven platforms and blockchain were explored. The discussion included their potential to transform ITSM practices by enhancing service delivery and driving innovation. Practical applications of these technologies in real-world scenarios were also highlighted.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Case Study: Managing ITSM in Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments</strong></p>
													<p>The case study examined strategies for managing SLAs and ensuring consistent service delivery across hybrid and multi-cloud setups. It emphasized the challenges of maintaining compliance and operational efficiency in complex environments. Proposed strategies included automated monitoring tools and integrated compliance frameworks.</p>
												
													<p><strong>Reflective Journal: Improving Incident Management</strong></p>
													<p>Through reflective journal entries, I examined the incident management lifecycle, identifying areas for improvement such as reducing response times and enhancing communication during incidents. The entries also highlighted the importance of continuous feedback loops to refine processes and align them with best practices.</p>
