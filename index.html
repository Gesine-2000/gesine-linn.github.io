											<h3>Introduction Into EITM</h3>
											<p>This module explores the emerging field of Enterprise IT, highlighting its connection to modern trends like Automation, IoT, and Digital Transformation. It also examines how Enterprise IT compares with Industry X.0 and the technologies driving both. As business computing undergoes significant changes, these developments have given rise to the broader concept of Enterprise IT, making it an exciting and disruptive subject.</p></p>

											<h3>Security and Risk Management</h3>
											<p>In this module, I explored the interconnected nature of security and risk in modern businesses. I learned to apply both qualitative and quantitative risk assessments, using models like STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees to evaluate and prioritize potential threats. Additionally, I examined hybrid risk models for a more comprehensive risk approach.

												I developed skills in creating threat models and quantitative risk models, as well as understanding global security standards such as PCI-DSS. A key focus was on designing effective Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies, ensuring business continuity in the event of disruptions like cyberattacks or system failures.

											<h3>IT Service Management</h3>
											<p>In this IT Service Management (ITSM) module, I gained valuable insights into managing IT services effectively to align with organisational goals and customer needs. I explored core ITSM principles and practices, such as Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Incident Management, and the roles of Service Desk and Service Manager.

												Through practical exercises and discussions, I developed an understanding of how ITSM supports operational efficiency, compliance, and continuous improvement. I also learned how functional and non-functional requirements integrate with ITSM processes and how standards and legislation shape service delivery.
												
												The module challenged me to critically analyse IT service issues, evaluate methodologies and tools, and propose solutions that drive value while addressing social, ethical, and professional considerations. It also highlighted future opportunities in ITSM, such as automation and innovation.
												
												This experience has equipped me with the skills and knowledge to tackle ITSM challenges, improve processes, and contribute to organisational success.

											<h3>IT Project Management</h3>
											<p>The IT Project Management (ITPM) module offers a comprehensive exploration of how projects within the IT sector are planned, executed, and monitored to meet technical and business objectives. It examines the core characteristics and components of IT project management, distinguishing them from traditional project management approaches. The module covers industry-specific methodologies such as Agile and Waterfall, as well as key techniques for project estimation, risk management, and stakeholder engagement. Emphasis is placed on managing complexity, adapting to change, and delivering value in dynamic environments. Students will critically evaluate project management tools and frameworks, apply them to real-world IT scenarios, and consider ethical, social, and professional implications. The module also addresses emerging trends in the field, such as digital transformation and the integration of AI in project planning and execution.

											<h3>Data Science</h3>
											<p>The Data Science module provides a critical understanding of how organisations manage, analyse, and leverage data to support enterprise decision-making. It explores the concepts underlying Business Intelligence (BI) tools and their impact on digesting diverse data sources and formats to drive effective, enterprise-based systems.
												I developed knowledge of reporting systems and dashboards, learning how to transform raw data into actionable insights that align with business objectives. The module further emphasises the stakeholdersâ€™ perspective, focusing on data consolidation, preparation, and the alignment of information flows to strategic goals. It also introduces the management of data policies and regulatory frameworks, underlining the importance of compliance in modern data ecosystems.
